The world today demands too much explanation and display. When you feel something, you feel the pressure to express it in words. With the prevalence of social media, communicating is always predicated on "showing it to others," so there's always an element of performance. Every story becomes a drama. With an objective perspective, the truly "feeling" part is sidelined. The atmosphere of having to speak out, the atmosphere of having to be emotional to be understood, the atmosphere of having to go viralâ€”I'm probably tired of this atmosphere. Actually, I can speak more simply and casually. Life is inherently a beginning and an end, but not always. Today, I just got up, ate, and went to sleep. I want to follow my instincts and be more honest, without needing words, and I want to feel. Everyone probably has many thoughts, but I want to live more authentically, more primally. Thoughts and feelings can be complex.
